## Kickstarting with Excel Assignment 1

# Overview of Project

### Purpose
the purpose of this analysis is to make Louiseâ€™s aware about her fundraising goals, and how different projects
are affected with respect to multiple factors

## Analysis and Challenges

I first analysied the number of kickstarter campaigns launched and quickly found out the the biggest markets are US and GB with 3038 and 604 total fundraising campaign respectively. some of the data from multiple countries are listed below 

*Campaigns in countries*

After knowing the biggest market the challenge was to find which catagary was doing good or bad what are the factors were effecting these
this will enable Louise to concentrate more on successfull campaigns.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When doing deeper analysis on launch dates we took the data of all campaings according to the launch date.  It can be seen that the most favaourable time for these campaings are May,June and july. As from the previous table US and UK are the biggest market, this data shows that campaings starting in the summer months in these two countries have a higher success rate then in the winter months.

Now lets isolate one of the most popular catagory among the fundraising campaings **Theater and plays** 
this is evident from the bottom graphs of UK and US with respect to subcatagories, according to the dataset there are 314 and 671 plays performed in GB and US respectively.

## THEATER OUTCOME vs LAUNCH DATE

Also evident from this above chart that 111 plays were succesful in the month of may as compared to 52 failed in the same month but the gap of successful and failed plays becomes very close at the year end and begging of the year 

 ### *Conclusion*

1) There is a higher chance of success rate in the summer months.

2) Should avoid campaigns in 1st and 4th quarter or consider a favourable catagory with lower goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Following data is driven from outcome based on goals from whole dataset. This is a very interesting study where we can show that how the ranges of the goals have effected the outcome of the campaign.  looking at the chart we can drive that the highest success rate is when the goals are lower in value. 534 projects fall under the 5000 $ range mark and their success rate is 72% that is a very good sign as fundraising generated from this range will have a higher impact on success rate. IN order or attract more people Louise should concentrate on goal ranges of 1,000-10,000 and 35,000 and 50,000

### *Conclusion*

1)  lower gaols have a better chance of success and highest failiure rate is among the mid range plays from 20000-350000 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In this excersice gathering date and comparing it was a challenge as the diceristy is too large and focussing on a particular aspect might not show the clear picture

Lets Recap our results which are driven from the dataset provided about This fundraising campaign

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) There is a higher chance of success rate in the summer months.

2) Should avoid campaigns in 1st and 4th quarter or consider a favourable catagory with lower goals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1)  lower gaols have a better chance of success and highest failiure rate is among the mid range plays from 20000-350000 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitation of this dataset would be the diverse content and information gathered. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

ALthoug the charts created in this project are comprehensive and shows a clear picture - we can certianly add a few more. below are some examples 

1)  individual plays and their success rate
2)  Countries vs sub catagorieswith respect to success and failure rate
